      <p>Hello! My name is Alexandre Espinoza but I prefer to be called Alex! and I am from Guayaquil, Ecuador.
        I enjoy going to the gym and doing any type of intense and heavy exercise. I like to play sports such as
        volleyball and cycling when I am not at the gym. In my free time I like to play video games like League 
        of Legends, Minecraft, Counter Strike and Roblox with friends or alone. I am the youngest sibling , my
         sisters are 10 years older than me. I am the only boy in my mother's side of the family. We have 8 cats
        and I take care of 2 in particular. Their names are Noah and Sol.
